# DQMC

This repository contains C++ code for DQMC simulations of interacting fermions on arbitary lattices. The code (and earlier versions) were used in [arXiv:1404.3027](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.3027), [arXiv:1511.02878](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02878), and [arXiv:1609.07309](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07309). Note that this builds heavily on the [ALPS](http://alps.comp-phys.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) libraries for job scheduling and observable estimation.
